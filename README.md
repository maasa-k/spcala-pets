# spcaLA Pets

Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles (spcaLA) is working hard to make sure our fellow furry friends find loving homes!  Use this Gem to see the adoptable pets.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spcala_pets'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spcala_pets

## Usage

Use this CLI Gem to see the adoptable pets through spcaLA. 

Run the following in the terminal to get started:

```ruby
$ ruby bin/spcala-pets
```

You will then be prompted to view a list of pets available for adoption.  Enter the number to the left of the pet's name to see their breed, color, gender and location. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
